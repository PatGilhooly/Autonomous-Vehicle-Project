# Self-driving Car Simulation

This project is adapted from Udacity's Car path planning project.
https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project

This project implements trajectory planning and generation using C++. Lane decision making and behavioural planning is governed by a cost function. The logic can be found in the main.cpp folder (Autonomous-Vehicle-Project/src).

## Cost Function Logic

For each of the cars in the simulation, determine their lane. Using a cost function with a cost for each lane (3 costs, total), check 4 conditions and modify the cost of each lane. Increase the cost if there is a car ahead in the lane. Increase the cost of a lane if there is a car beside the ego car. Increase the cost of changing to a lane by a large number if it is more than one lane away. Finally, decrease the cost of the ego carâ€™s current lane. Find the lowest cost, set this as the target lane, and change to that lane using the trajectory planning. Using a Boolean array, check if the ego should slow down or speed up based on if there is a car ahead in its lane and whether the car is at the maximum speed.
